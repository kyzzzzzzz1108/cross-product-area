# Cross Product and Area in R3

This project computes the cross product of two vectors in R3 and verifies its geometric properties.

## Description

Given two vectors u and v, the script computes u × v, checks that it is orthogonal to both vectors, and uses its magnitude to compute the area of the parallelogram and triangle spanned by u and v.

## Files

- `cross_product_area.py`: Python script for cross product and area computation.

## How to run

```bash
python3 cross_product_area.py
